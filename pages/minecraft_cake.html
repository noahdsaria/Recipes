    <h2>
            Ingredients:
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 1/3 cups of all purpose flour
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 cup of cocoa powder
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon of baking powder
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 teaspoon of salt
        </li>
        <li>
            1 cup milk
        </li>
        <li>
            1 1/3 cups white sugar
        </li>
        <li>
            1 cup unsalted butter, softened
        </li>
        <li>
            4 eggs
        </li>
        <li>
            2 teaspoons vanilla extract
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>

    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch square cake pans.</p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>

    <p>Make the cake: Sift 2 1/3 cups plus 1 1/2 tablespoons flour, 1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Combine 1 cup plus 1/2 tablespoon milk in a liquid measure.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>

    <p>Beat white sugar and butter together in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Add flour mixture alternately with milk, mixing batter gently between after addition. Divide batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.</p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Assemble and decorate the cake. Check out <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/254203/minecraft-cake/" target="_blank" rel ="noopener noreferrer">allrecipes.com</a>
